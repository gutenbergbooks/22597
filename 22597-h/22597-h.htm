<h1><big>QUESTION<br />
OF COMFORT</big></h1>

<h2><small>By LES COLLINS</small></h2>





<p class="cap">MY JOB, finished now, had
been getting them to Disneyland.
The problem was bringing
one in particular&mdash;one I had
to find. The timing was uncomfortably
close.</p>

<p>I'd taken the last of the yellow
pills yesterday, tossing the
bottle away with a sort of indifferent
frustration. I won or lost
on the validity of my logic&mdash;and
whether I'd built a better
mousetrap.</p>

<p>The pills had given me 24
hours before the fatal weakness
took hold; nevertheless, I waited
as long as I could. That left me
less than an hour, now; strangely,
as I walked in the eerie darkness
of an early morning, virtually
deserted Disneyland, I felt
calm. And yet, my life depended
on the one I sought being inside
the Tour building.</p>

<p>I was seeking a monster of
terrible potential, yet so innocuous
looking that he'd not stand
out. I couldn't produce him,
couldn't say where in the world
he was. Nevertheless he was the
basis, the motivation second
only to mine. I took the long,
hard way&mdash;three years&mdash;making
him come to me.</p>

<p>Two years were devoted to acclimatization,
learning, and then
swinging this job: just to put
the idea across.</p>

<p>Assigned to Disneyland Public
Relations in the offices at
Burbank, I'd begun with the
usual low-pay, low-level jobs. I
didn't, couldn't mind; at least
I had a foot in the right door.
Within six months, I reached a
point where I could present the
idea.</p>

<p>It had enough merit. My boss&mdash;35
years' experience enabled
him to recognize a good idea&mdash;took
it to his boss who took it to
The Boss.</p>

<p>Tomorrowland is the orphan
division of Disneyland, thrown
in as sop to those interested
more in the future than the
past. My idea was to sex up Tomorrowland:
Tour the Solar
System.</p>

<p>Not really, but we'd bill it
that way. The Tour of the Solar
System Building was to be
large. Its rooms would reproduce
environments of parts of the
System, as best we knew them.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I'll never forget the first
planning session when we realists
were underdogs, yet swung
the basic direction. By then, the
Hollywood Mind had appeared.
The Hollywood Mind is definitely
a real thing, a vicious thing,
a blank thing, that paternalistically
insists It knows what the
public wants.</p>

<p>There was general agreement
on broad outlines. Trouble began
over Venus.</p>

<p>"Of course," said one of the
Minds, "we'll easily create a
swampy environment&mdash;"</p>

<p>I burst out with quiet desperation:
"May I comment?"</p>

<p>The realists were churning.
Right there, sides were being
chosen. I let all know my side
immediately.</p>

<p>"Venus is hot, but it's desert
heat. Continuous dust storms
with fantastic winds&mdash;"</p>

<p>"People'd never go for that
junk," interrupted the Mind.
"Everyone knows Venus is
swampy."</p>

<p>"Everyone whose reading
tastes matured no further than
Edgar Rice Burroughs!"</p>

<p>The Mind, with a if-you-know-so-much-why-aintcha-rich
look,
sneered, "How come you know
all about it?"</p>

<p>Speechless, I spread my
hands. This joker was leading
with his chin, forcing the fight.
I had to hit him again; if I lost,
I lost good. "A person," I said
slowly and rhythmically, "with
normal intelligence and a minute
interest in the universe, will
keep step with the major sciences,
at least on an elementary
level. I must stress the qualification
of normal intelligence."</p>

<p>The Mind, face contorted, was
determined to get me. I was in a
very vulnerable spot; more important,
so was the idea.</p>

<p>Mind began an emotional tirade,
and mentally I damned
him. It couldn't have mattered
to him what environment we
used, but he was politicking
where he shouldn't.</p>

<p>There was silence when he
stopped. This was the crux; The
Boss would decide. I held my
breath.</p>

<p>He said, "We'll make it hot
and dusty." The realists had
won; the rest climbed on the
bandwagon but quick; and the
temple was cleansed.</p>

<p>It was natural&mdash;because at
the moment I was fair-haired&mdash;for
the project to become mine.
God knows, I worked hard for
it. I'd have to watch the Mind,
though; he would make things
as difficult as possible.</p>

<p>However, he'd proved he was
the one person I wasn't seeking.
One down and 2,499,999,999 to
go.</p>

<p>Within a few days, a new opposition
coalition formed, headed
by the Mind. Fortunately,
they helped. I'd hesitated on one
last point. Pushed. I gambled
the momentum of the initial enthusiasm
would carry it.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Originally the plan was a
series of rooms, glassed off, that
people could stare into. There
was something much better; engineering
and I spent 36 hours
straight, figuring costs, juggling
space and equipment, until
the modification didn't look too
expensive&mdash;juggling is always
possible in technical proposals.
For the results, the cost was
worth it. I hand-carried the
proposal in.</p>

<p>Why not take people <i>through</i>
the rooms? We could even design
a simulated, usable spacesuit.
There'd be airlock doors
between the rooms for effectiveness,
insulation, economy. No
children under ten allowed; no
adults over 50. They'd go
through in groups of 10 or 11.</p>

<p>Sure, I realized this was the
most elaborate, most ambitious
concession ever planned. The
greatest ever attempted in its
line, it would cost&mdash;both us and
the public. But people will pay
for value. They'd go for a buck-and-a-half
or even two; the lines
of those filing past the windows,
at 50 cents a crack, would also
bring in the dough.</p>

<p>They bought it. Not all&mdash;they
nixed my idea of creating exact
environmental conditions; and I
didn't insist, luck and Hollywood
being what they are.</p>

<p>From the first, I established a
special group to work on one
problem. They were dubbed the
Gravity Gang, and immediately
after, the GG. I hired them for
the gravity of the situation, a
standard gag that, once uttered,
became as trite as the phrase.
The Tour's realism would be
affected by normal weight sensations.</p>

<p>The team consisted of a female
set designer&mdash;who'd turn
any male head&mdash;from the Studio,
a garage mechanic with 30
years' experience, an electronics
engineer, a science fiction writer,
and the prettiest competent
secretary available. I found
Hazel, discovering with delight
she'd had three years of anthropology
at UCLA.</p>

<p>As soon as they assembled, I
explained their job: find a way
to give the illusion of lessened
gravity.</p>

<p>Working conditions would be
the best possible&mdash;why I'd wanted
the women pretty&mdash;and their
time was their own. I found the
GG responded by working 10
hours a day and thinking another
14. They were that sort.</p>

<p>I couldn't know the GG was
foredoomed to failure by its
very collective nature; nor could
I know, by its nature, the GG
meant the difference between
my success and failure.</p>

<p>The opposition put one over;
we'd started referring to the
job as Tour of the System Project.
Next day, it was going the
rounds as TS project. Words,
words, and men will always fight
with words.</p>

<p>Actually, the initials were
worthy of the name. The engineering
problems mounted like
crazy. Words, words, and one of
them got to the outside world.
Or maybe it was the additional
construction crew we hired.</p>

<p>One logical spot for the building
was next to the moon flight.
The Tour building now would be
bigger than first planned, so we
extended it southeasterly. This
meant changing the roadbed of
the Santa Fe &amp; Disneyland R.R.
It put me up to my ears in plane
surveying&mdash;and gave me a nasty
shock.</p>

<p>I looked up at someone's
shout, in time to see a ton of cat
rolling down the embankment at
me.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>What we were doing was
easy. Using a spiral to transition
gradually from tangent to
circular curve and from circular
curve to tangent. Easy? Yeah.
Sure.</p>

<p>If this was my baby, I'd
damned well better know its
personality traits. I was out
with the surveyors, I was out
with the construction gang, I
was out at the wrong time.</p>

<p>As the yellow beast, mindless
servant of man, thundered
down, I dove for the rocks.
Thank God for the rocks&mdash;we'd
had to import them: the soil in
Orange County is fine for
oranges, but too soft for train
roadbeds.</p>

<p>Choking on the dust, I rolled
over. The cat perched, grinning
drunkenly, on the rocks. The opposition
or an accident? Surely
the Mind wasn't <i>that</i> desperate.
But I was; I had to keep the
idea alive, for myself as well as
completion of the original mission.</p>

<p>Several million hands pulled
me out; several million more
patted away the dust. Motionless,
I'd just seen the driver of
the cat. Seen him&mdash;and was
sorry.</p>

<p>He stood tall but hunched
over; gaunt, with pasty skin,
vapid eyes, and a kind of yellow-nondescript
hair.</p>

<p>It wasn't the physical characteristics,
very similar to mine,
that bothered me&mdash;once after an
incomplete pass, I'd been told by
a young lady that I was a "thin,
sallow lecher." I was swept by
waves of impending trouble,
more frightened of him than of
the opposition in toto. Then, relieved,
I realized the man wasn't
the one I was expecting.</p>

<p>Back in my office, I wasn't allowed
the luxury of nervous reaction.
Our spacesuit man wanted
an Ok on design changes.
Changes? What changes?...
Oh, yes, go ahead.</p>

<p>A materials man wanted to
know about weight. I told him
where to go&mdash;for the information.</p>

<p>A written progress report
from the GG briefly, sardonically,
said: "All the talk about increased
costs and lowered budget
has decided us to ask if any
aircraft, missile, or AEC groups
have come up with anti-gravity.
It'd be a lot simpler that way.
Love and kisses."</p>

<p>I shrugged, wrote them a
memo to take a week off for
fishing, wenching, or reading
Van Es on the Pleistocene stratigraphy
of Java. I didn't care,
as long as they returned with a
fresh point of view.</p>

<p>Things were hectic already,
less than four months after we'd
started. And we hadn't much to
show, except a shift in the roadbed
of the SF &amp; D RR. The opposition,
growing stronger each
day, could sit back and rest the
case, with nothing more than a
smug, needling, I-told-you-so
look.</p>

<p>The day finally came when we
broke ground for the building.
It was quite an achievement,
and I invited the GG to dinner.
I'd been drawn to the bunch of
screwballs&mdash;the only name possible&mdash;more
and more. Maybe
because they were my brain-child,
or maybe because lately
they were the only human company
in which I could relax.</p>

<p>The Hotel is about a half-mile
south of Disneyland. I arrived
early, hoping to grab a ginger
ale. Our set designer, Frank&mdash;christened
Francis&mdash;caught me
at the door.</p>

<p>"Wanted to buy you a drink.
This is the first time we've met
socially."</p>

<p>That was true; it was equally
true something bothered her.
Damn it! Trapped, I'd have to
drink. We ordered, and I mulled
it over. Waited, but she said
nothing.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The drinks came. I shook several
little, bright-yellow pills
from the bottle, swallowed them,
then drank. Frank cocked her
head inquisitively.</p>

<p>"If you must know, they're
for my ulcer."</p>

<p>"Didn't know you had one."</p>

<p>"Don't, but I'll probably get
one, any day."</p>

<p>She laughed, and I drank
again. I should do my drinking
alone because I get boiled incredibly
fast. It happened now. One
second I was sober; the next,
drunk.</p>

<p>Resting a cheek on a wobbly
palm-and-elbow, I said, "Has
everyone ever said you are the
most beautiful&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, but in your present
state, it isn't a good idea for you
to add to that number."</p>

<p>I shifted to the other forearm.
"Frank, things might be different
if I weren't a thin, sallow
lecher."</p>

<p>"What a nice compliment&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Uh huh."</p>

<p>"Especially since I work for
you, nominally anyway&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Uh huh, nominally."</p>

<p>"Bosses should not make passes<br />
At gals who work as lower classes."</p>

<p>"Uh, huh, familiar."</p>

<p>"But you are, and getting
more so daily&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Uh hu&mdash;are what?" I asked
in surprise.</p>

<p>"Thin, tired: the GG has decided
you're working too hard."</p>

<p>"Because I don't use Vano." I
grinned, having waited long to
put that one across.</p>

<p>"Be serious and listen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> listen: if I'm working
too hard, it's to finish. I <i>must</i>,
and soon."</p>

<p>"This compulsion," she paced
her words, "will kill you if you
let it."</p>

<p>"It'll kill me if I don't let
it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here comes Harry."</p>

<p>It was time. Blearily, I fumbled
with the pills, spilled the
bottle. Frank helped me gather
them up, as Harry arrived.</p>

<p>He said, a look of worry on
his gaunt, gray features, "The
rest of us are waiting."</p>

<p>Concerned, Frank asked,
"Think you're able?"</p>

<p>"Anytime you say," I answered,
in a cold-sober monotone.</p>

<p>She flushed, knowing I was
sober, not knowing certainly if
I were serious.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>When we were seated, I said
enthusiastically, "Chateaubriand
tonight, gangsters."</p>

<p>The GG did not react as expected.</p>

<p>Dex, the electronics engineer,
said quietly, "If it's steak when
the ground is broken, what'll it
be when the thing is finished?"</p>

<p>"A feast, for all the animals
in the world&mdash;just like Suleiman-bin-Daoud."
This, from the
GG writer, Mel.</p>

<p>Their faces showed the same
thing that bothered Frank.</p>

<p>Harry said, "We have something
to do."</p>

<p>"Well, do it!" I tried weak
joviality: "It can't be anything
of earth-shaking gravity."</p>

<p>Hazel, long since accepted as
a GG member, replied, "It's just
that we're ... resigned."</p>

<p>"<i>What?</i>"</p>

<p>"We've produced nothing in
months of sustained effort.
That's why we're resigning,"
Dex replied disgustedly.</p>

<p>Frank touched my arm, said
softly, "We've examined every
angle. With the money available,
it's just impossible to give a
sensation of changed weight.
And we know they've been pressuring
you about us being on
the payroll."</p>

<p>"Wait"&mdash;desperately&mdash;"if you
pull out, everything will go. The
opposition needs only something
like this. Besides, the GG is the
one bit of insanity I can depend
on in a practical world, the prop
for my judgment&mdash;"</p>

<p>Harry: "Clouded judgment."</p>

<p>Mel: "Expensive prop."</p>

<p>Having grown used to their
friendly insults, I sensed their
resolution weakening, felt the
pendulum swinging back.</p>

<p>The waitress interrupted with
news of an urgent phone call. It
was the worst possible time for
me to leave. And the news I got
threw me. Feeling the weight of
the world, I returned.</p>

<p>"Can't be in two places at
once," I said bitterly. "Go ahead
without me; I'm leaving."</p>

<p>"Wait a few minutes," Mel
said, between bites of steak, "we
want to resign. Sit down."</p>

<p>"Damn it, I can't! I spoke to
The Boss. I've pulled a boo-boo,
but big."</p>

<p>"What happened?"</p>

<p>"Bonestell will do the backgrounds,
but he has to know
what rocks we're putting in the
rooms. What rocks are we?
Anybody have an idea what the
surface of Mars looks like? God,
how could I have missed that?"</p>

<p>"Sit down," Dex said casually,
"we want to resign."</p>

<p>Hazel added, "You can have
your rocks in 24 hours. We
worked it out weeks ago. I <i>did</i>
read Van Es, and Harry has
prospected, and Dex knows minerals,
and Mel pushed his way
through Tyrrell's 'Principles of
Petrology'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The science of rocks," Mel
interrupted, between bites of
steak.</p>

<p>"We got interested one day."
Frank's pretty, dark eyes
danced.</p>

<p>"We want to resign," Dex repeated
casually, "so sit down."</p>

<p>I sat.</p>

<p>They began throwing the ball
faster than I could catch: "No
atmosphere on Mercury, then no
oxidation; I insist there'd be no
straight metals.... The asteroids?
Ferromagnesian blocks of
some kind&mdash;any basalts around
here?... For Venus, grab a
truckload of granodiorite&mdash;the
spotted stuff&mdash;from the Sierra-Nevadas
and tint it pink....
Lateritic soils for Mars? You
crazy? Must have water and a
subtropical climate...."</p>

<p>It hit me: a valid use for the
GG, one that already saved money.
Make them a brain team,
trouble-shooters, or problem-solvers
on questions that could
not be solved.</p>

<p>I said, "Fine, go ahead. About
your resignations&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mel said something indistinguishable&mdash;I'd
caught him <i>on</i> a
bite of steak.</p>

<p>Hazel, belligerent, demanded:
"Are you asking <i>us</i> to resign?"</p>

<p>Apparently I wasn't. So they
stuck, and another crisis was
met. Unfortunately, by then, I'd
forgotten the shock and warning
I got from the cat.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Things moved swiftly, more
easily. The GG took over, becoming,
in effect, my staff.
They'd become more: five different
extensions of me, each capable
of acting correctly. As a
team, they meshed beautifully.</p>

<p>Too beautifully, at one point.
Dex and Hazel were seeing eye-to-eye,
even in the dark, and I
worried about the effect on the
others. I might as well have
worried about the effect of a
light bulb on the sun. They married
or some such, refused time
off, and the GG functioned, if
anything, better. It was almost
indecent the way the five got
along together.</p>

<p>A new problem arose: temperature.
We weren't reproducing
actual temperatures, but the
rooms needed a marked change,
for reality's sake. I'd insisted
on that, and having won the
point, was stuck with it. It was
after 2 A.M.; I was alone in the
office.</p>

<p>The sound of the outer door
closing startled me. Footsteps
approached; I hurried to clean
my desk, sweeping the bottle
into the drawer.</p>

<p>"You're up too late. Go home."
Frank had a nonarguable look
in her eye. "You're supposed to
be getting sleep."</p>

<p>"I am, far more than before
you guys began helping, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But with all that extra sleep,
you're looking worse."</p>

<p>"I don't <i>need</i> any more sleep!"
I said angrily, then tried diversion,
"Been on a date?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I thought I'd better
check on you." She moved close
to the desk, and I remembered
the last time we'd been alone,
in the bar. Now I was glad I
wasn't drunk.</p>

<p>"What the devil are you up
to?"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>She pawed through the desk
drawers. "Finding what you
tried to hide&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait, Frank!" I yelled, too
late.</p>

<p>She looked at the bottle, then
me, with a strange expression:
a little pity&mdash;not patronizing&mdash;but
mostly feminine understanding.
"Soda pop? Of course. You
don't like alcohol, do you?"</p>

<p>"No." Gruffly.</p>

<p>Her eyes blinked rapidly, as
though holding back tears. "I
know what's the matter with
you; I <i>really</i> know."</p>

<p>"There's nothing the matter
with me that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That beating this mess won't
solve." We hadn't heard Mel
enter. He leaned casually
against the door. "Terrific idea
for a story."</p>

<p>I shrugged. "Seems to be
homecoming night."</p>

<p>"Not quite," he glanced at his
watch, "but wait another few
minutes."</p>

<p>He was right: Harry, out of
breath, was the last of the GG
to arrive.</p>

<p>"Now what?" I asked. "Surely
this meeting isn't an accident?"</p>

<p>Dex said thoughtfully, "No,
not really, but it is in the sense
you mean. We didn't agree to
appear tonight. Yet logically,
it's time for the temperature
problem&mdash;well, I guess each of
us came down to help."</p>

<p>What could I do? That was
the GG, characteristically, so we
talked temperatures.</p>

<p>"What I was thinking," Harry
began slowly, "was a sort of
superthermostat." Harry, as
usual, came to the right starting
point.</p>

<p>Frank smiled, "That's right,
especially considering layout.
Venus and Mercury are hot; the
others, cold. What about a control
console that'll light when
the rooms get outside normal
temperature range? Then the
operator&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hey! Why an operator?"
Mel questioned. "We ought to
make this automatic." He grinned.
"Giant computer ... can
see it now: the brain comes
alive, tries to destroy anyone
turning it off&mdash;"</p>

<p>I asked: "Have you been
<i>reading</i> the stuff you write?"
Funny enough for 3 A.M.</p>

<p>Dex said calmly, "We <i>can</i>
work this&mdash;in fact, we can tie it
in pink ribbons and forget it.
An electronics outfit in Pasadena
makes an automatic scanning
and logging system. Works off
punched-paper tape. We'll code
the right poop, and the system
will compare it with the actual
raw data. Feedback will be to a
master control servo that'll activate
the heater or cooler. Now,
we need the right pickup&mdash;"</p>

<p>I snapped my fingers. "Variable
resistor bridge. Couple of
resistors equal at the right temperature.
There'll be a frequency
change with changing temperature&mdash;better
than a thermocouple,
I think."</p>

<p>They looked at me as though
I were butting in.</p>

<p>"You've been reading, too,"
Dex accused. "Ok, we'll use a
temperature bulb. Trouble is,
with this system, we'd better
let it run continuously. That'll
drive costs up."</p>

<p>Hazel asked, "Can't we use
the heat, maybe to drive a compressor?
The sudden expansion
of air could cool the rest.
Harry?"</p>

<p>Harry hadn't time to answer.</p>

<p>"What'll this cost?" I snapped.</p>

<p>"Roughly, 15 to 18 thousand,"
Dex replied.</p>

<p>"<i>What?</i>"</p>

<p>With fine impartiality, they
ignored me completely. Harry
continued, as though without
interruption, "Ye-es, I guess a
compressor-and-coolant system
could be arranged ..."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We broke up at 6 A.M. I took
one of my pills, frowning at the
bottle. Seemed to be emptying
fast. Sleepily, I shook the
thought off and faced the new
day&mdash;little knowing the opposition
had managed to skizzle us
again.</p>

<p>The last displays were moons
of Jupiter and Saturn; it was
impossible to recreate tortured
conditions of the planets themselves.
Saturn's closest moon,
Mimas, was picked.</p>

<p>Our grand finale: landing on
Mimas with Saturn rising spectacularly
out of the east. Mimas
is in the plane of the rings, so
they couldn't be obvious. We'd
show enough, however, to make
it damned impressive, and explain
it by libration of the
satellite.</p>

<p>The mechanics of realistically
moving Saturn was rougher
than a cob. And that's where the
opposition fixed us. They claimed
there wasn't enough drama
in the tour. Let it end with a
flash of light, a roar, and a
meteor striking nearby.</p>

<p>The roar came from us.
Mimas had no atmosphere&mdash;how
could the meteor sound off or
burn up? We finally compromised,
permitting the meteor to
hit.</p>

<p>We'd decided early the customers
couldn't walk through.
Mel first, Harry, then Dex, together
produced an electric-powered,
open runabout. The
cart ran on treads in contact
with skillfully hidden tracks,
for the current channel. A futuristic
touch, that&mdash;we'd say
the cart ran on broadcast power.</p>

<p>The power source provided
cart headlights, and made batteries
unnecessary for the
guide's walkie-talkie and the
customers' helmet receivers.</p>

<p>Mimas' last section of track
was on a vibrating platform.
The cart tripped a switch; when
the meteor supposedly hit, the
platform would drop and rise
three inches, fast, twisting
while it did&mdash;"enough," Mel
said grimly, "to shake the damned
<i>kishkas</i> out of 'em!"</p>

<p>We cracked that one, just in
time for another. It began with
Venus, as most of my problems
had. We planned constant dust
storms for Venus. Real quick,
there'd be nothing left of the
Bonestell's backgrounds but a
blank wall, from mechanical
erosion.</p>

<p>And how did we intend&mdash;?</p>

<p>Glass&mdash;</p>

<p>Too easily scratched. Lord,
another one: how will the half-a-buck
customers be able to see
inside?</p>

<p>Glass and one of those silicon
plastics?</p>

<p>Better, but&mdash;</p>

<p>Harry beat it: glass, plastic,
<i>and</i> a boundary layer of cold air,
jetted down from the ceiling, in
front of the background painting
and back of the look-in window.
I was glad, for lately,
Harry had begun to age. Thin
and gray, he showed the strain&mdash;as
did all of us.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We were sitting in an administration
office at the park. I
now recognized the symptoms;
when the GG had no real problems,
its collective mind usually
turned to my health. I wouldn't
admit it, but I felt a little peaked.
Little? Hell, bone-tired, dog-weary
pooped. Seemed every
motion was effort, but soon it
would end.</p>

<p>The phone rang. With the
message, it <i>was</i> ended.</p>

<p>"Let's go, grouseketeers."</p>

<p>There was almost a pregnant
pause. Six months: conception
of the idea to delivery of finished
product; six months, working
together, fighting men, nature,
and the perversity of inanimate
objects&mdash;all of this now
was done.</p>

<p>No one moved; Frank verbalized
it: "I'm scared." She
sounded scared.</p>

<p>"Better than being petrified,
which I am," I answered. "But
we might as well face it."</p>

<p>We dragged over to the TS
building, an impressive structure.</p>

<p>The guide played it straight,
told us exactly how to suit up.
Then, in the cart, we edged into
the tunnel that was the first
lock, and&mdash;warned to set our filters&mdash;emerged
onto the blinding
surface of Mercury.</p>

<p>We felt the heat momentarily&mdash;Mercury
and Venus were kept
at a constant 140 F, the others
at 0 F&mdash;but it was a deliberate
thrill. Then cool air from the
cart suit-connections began circulating.</p>

<p>Bonestell was magnificent, as
always. Yellow landscape, spatter
cones, glittering streaks that
might be metal in the volcanic
ground&mdash;created by dusting
ground mica on wet glue to
catch the reflection of the sun.
It was a masterpiece.</p>

<p>The sun. Black sky holding a
giant, blazing ball. Too damned
yellow, but filtered carbon arcs
were the best we could do.</p>

<p>Down, into the tunnel that
was lock two. This next one ...
Venus, obvious opposition point
of attack, where we'd had the
most trouble: Venus <i>had</i> to be
right.</p>

<p>It was! A blast of wind struck
us, and dust, swirling everywhere.
We'd discovered there's
no such thing as a sand storm&mdash;it's
really dust&mdash;so we'd taken
pains making things look right.
Sand dunes were carefully cemented
in place; dust rippling
over gave the proper illusion.</p>

<p>Oddly shaped rocks, dimly
seen, strengthened the impression
of wind-abraded topography.
Rocks were reddish, overlain
by smears of bright yellow.
Lot of trouble placing all that
flowers of sulfur, but we postulated
a liquid sulfur-sulfur dioxide-carbon
dioxide cycle.</p>

<p>Overhead, a diffused, intense
yellow light. The sun&mdash;we were
on the daylight side.</p>

<p>I sighed, relaxed, knowing
this one had worked out.</p>

<p>We gave the moon little time.
For those who had become
homesick, Earth was hanging
magnificently in the sky. At a
crater wall, we stopped, ostensibly
to let souvenir hunters pick
at small pieces of lunar rock
without leaving the cart.</p>

<p>We'd argued hours on what
type to use, till Mel dragged out
his rock book. Most, automatically,
had wanted basalt. However,
the moon's density being
low, heavier rocks are probably
scarce&mdash;one good reason not to
expect radioactive ores there.
We finally settled for rhyolite
and obsidian.</p>

<p>Stopping on the moon had another
purpose. We kept the room
temperature at 70 F, for heating
and cooling economy; the
transition from Venus to Mars
was much simpler if ambient
temperature dropped from 140
to 70 and from 70 to 0, rather
than straight through the range.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Next, a Martian polar cap,
and we looked down a long canal
that disappeared on the horizon.
Water appeared to run uphill
for that effect. The whole scene
looked like an Arizona highway
at dusk&mdash;what it should have.
To our right, a suggestion of&mdash;damn
the opposition's eyes&mdash;culture:
a large stone whatzit.
It was a jarring note.</p>

<p>We selected one of those nondescript
asteroids with just
enough diameter to show extreme
curvature. Frank had
done magnificently. I found myself
hanging onto the cart.
Headlights deliberately dimmed,
on the rocky surface, the cart
bumped wildly. The sky was
black, broken only by little, hard
chunks of light. No horizon. The
feeling of being ready to drop
was intense, possibly too much
so.</p>

<p>Europa, then, in a valley of
ice. We'd picked Jupiter's third
moon because its frozen atmosphere
permitted some eerie
pseudo-ice sculpturing. As we
moved, Jupiter appeared between
breaks and peaks in the
sheer wall. Worked nicely, seeing
the monstrous planet distended
overhead, like a gaily
colored beach ball moving with
us, as the moon from a train
window. Unfortunately, the ice
forms detracted somewhat.</p>

<p>Mimas, pitch black, then a
glow. Stark landscape quickly
becoming visible. Steep cliffs,
rocky plain. Saturn rising. The
rings, their shadow on the globe,
the beauty of it, made me sit
stunned, though I knew what to
expect.</p>

<p>The guide warned us radar
spotted an approaching object,
probably a meteor. We ran, the
cart at maximum speed&mdash;not
much, really. It tore at you,
wanting to stare at Saturn,
wanting to duck.</p>

<p>Hit the special section, dropped
and rose our three inches&mdash;one
hell of a distance&mdash;and the
tour was over. I kept thinking,
insanely, that the meteor <i>was</i> a
perfect conflict touch.</p>

<p>We unsuited silently. Finally,
Hazel breathed, "Hallelujah!" It
was summation of success. There
now remained but one thing:
wait for the quarry to show.</p>

<p>I estimated the necessary
time at four days and nights
after opening. It was hard to
wait, hard not to fidget under
the watchful&mdash;the only word&mdash;eyes
of the GG. They were up
to something, undoubtedly. But
there was something far more
important: I'd narrowed the
2,499,999,999 down to five.</p>

<p>The one I sought was a member
of the GG.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Opening night brought Harry
and Frank to my office. They
tried to be casual, engaged me
in desultory nothings. Frank
looked reproachful&mdash;I was there
too late.</p>

<p>The following night, Mel ambled
in at midnight. He grinned,
discussed a plot, suggested we
go out for a beer, changed his
mind, left.</p>

<p>The third night, I waited in
the dark. Nor was I disappointed:
Dex and Hazel showed.</p>

<p>"What do you want? It's 2
A.M.!"</p>

<p>There was a long regrouping
pause; then Hazel said, "Dex
has a fine idea."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I've been thinking about
gravity&mdash;"</p>

<p>"About time," I said sarcastically,
disliking myself but hoping
it would get rid of them,
"we opened three days ago."</p>

<p>He ignored my petulance and
grinned. "No, I meant anti-gravity.
I think it's possible. If
you had a superconductor in an
inductance field&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why tell me?"</p>

<p>"Thought you'd have some
ideas."</p>

<p>I shook my head. "That's
what I hired <i>you</i> for. My only
idea right now is going to
sleep."</p>

<p>Bewildered, they left.</p>

<p>And on the fourth night, no
one came. So I headed for the
Tour. Now, having risked everything
on my logic, I was a dead
pigeon if wrong. There were
only minutes left.</p>

<p>I eased through the back door,
heard our automation equipment
humming. Despite darkness, I
shortcutted, nearly reaching the
door to the service hallway in
back of the planetary rooms.
There was a distinct click, and a
flashlight blinded me. I waited,
stifling a cry, knowing if it
were he, death was next.</p>

<p>Death never spoke in such
quiet, sweet tones. Frank asked,
"What are you doing here?"</p>

<p><i>Frank, Frank, not you!</i></p>

<p>Surprise shocked me: the
light, her voice, the sudden suspicion.
Still, diversion and counterattack ...
"Perhaps you've
the explaining to do," I said
nastily. "Why are you here?"</p>

<p>Her wide-eyed ingenuousness
making me more suspicious, she
answered, "Waiting to see if
you'd appear." Then she stopped
being truthful: "You forget we
had a date&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We didn't have any damned
date," I said flatly, hurting deep
within.</p>

<p>"All right, I want to know
why you're still driving yourself.
It isn't work; that's finished."</p>

<p>The way she talked made me
hopeful. Maybe she wasn't the
one ... and then came fear.
Frank, if he's here, you're in
danger. The monster respects
nothing we hold dear&mdash;law,
property, dignity, life.</p>

<p>There was one way to find
out: make her leave. I wrenched
the flashlight from her, smashed
it on the concrete floor. "I mean
this: get the hell out of here,
and stay out!"</p>

<p>She said, distastefully, "I've
seen it happen, but never this
fast. You've gone Hollywood,
you're a genius, you're tremendous&mdash;forgetting
other people
who helped. Go ahead with your
mysterious deal&mdash;and I hope we
never meet again."</p>

<p>I struggled with ambivalence.
This might be a trick; if not,
Frank now hated me irreparably.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>No time to worry about human
emotions, not any more.
Nausea reminded me of the primary
purpose. I continued down
the dark hallway, listening for
Frank's return, hoping she
needn't die.</p>

<p>Light was unnecessary: I
knew the right door. Because it
started here, it would end here.
Quickly, silently, I slipped inside
the Venus room. With peculiar
relief, I realized Frank wasn't
it: my nose led me right to the
monster.</p>

<p>In an ecstatic, semistuporous
state, smelling strongly of sulfur
dioxide, he couldn't have
been aware of me. Couldn't?</p>

<p>"It took you long enough." He
didn't bother to turn from the
rock he was huddled against.</p>

<p>"I had to be sure." I felt anything
but the calm carried in my
voice. "No wonder the GG got
the right answers, with you
making initial starts. Say, were
you responsible for the cat that
rolled at me?"</p>

<p>"An accident. Obviously, I
wanted this room built as much
as you." Harry, now undisguised,
languorously turned.
"Your little trap didn't quite
come off&mdash;a danger in fighting
a superior intellect."</p>

<p>"No trap. I had a job to do;
it's done."</p>

<p>"Job? Job?" Infuriated, leaping
to his feet, he shouted,
"Speak the native tongue, filth!"</p>

<p>"What's the use? Because of
you, I'll never again have the
chance. And you no longer have
a native tongue."</p>

<p>"Who were those judges," he
asked bitterly, "to declare <i>me</i> an
outcast?"</p>

<p>"Representatives of an outraged
society." I almost lost my
temper, thinking of this deviant's
crimes. "You were lucky to
get banishment instead of
death."</p>

<p>He grinned. "So were you."</p>

<p>"True. I tried to find the
proper place, where you'd have
some chance."</p>

<p>He laughed openly. "I fixed
the ship nicely."</p>

<p>"You don't understand at
all&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I counted on your being a
hero, trying to save us. So, I
escaped."</p>

<p>"For three years only."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"One of us won't leave here."</p>

<p>Harry frowned, then tried
cunning. "Aren't you being
silly? We are hopelessly marooned.
Surely there are overriding
considerations to your childish
devotion to duty."</p>

<p>I shook my head. "This is too
small a room for us. Even if I
trusted you, I couldn't allow you
at this naive young world."</p>

<p>Voices suddenly approached.
"The GG?" Harry questioned.</p>

<p>"Didn't know they were coming."
Desperately, I looked
about, found an eroded mass.
"Hide there; I'll get rid of
them."</p>

<p>"You'd better&mdash;we have business."
Possibly it was the only
time I've agreed with him. Mel
and Dex came in. I called, "Over
here!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Dex snapped his fingers.
"<i>Knew</i> it was Venus."</p>

<p>Mel wrinkled his nose. "Sulfur
dioxide, too, like we figured.
Soda pop, when I broke into
that tender scene between you
and Frank&mdash;that gave you necessary
carbon dioxide, right, am
I not?"</p>

<p>"Yes ... Why don't you guys
leave me alone?" Beginning to
falter in the heat, they dripped
perspiration. "You could die in
this chilly climate."</p>

<p>Dex said, "Listen for a second.
We don't have to break up.
Let's form a service organization,
'Problems, Inc.' or some
equally stupid title. Very soon
we could afford a private bedroom,
like this, for you to stay
in all the time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Need only two or three
nights in ten." Harry was moving
restlessly. He wouldn't wait
much longer. "Combination of
oxygen, carbon dioxide, and
sulfur under relatively high
temperature is how I eat. Pills
can substitute, but not for protracted
periods. That's why I
had to build this room. Couple
of weeks, and I'll be in the pink;
as pink as you, anyway."</p>

<p>Abruptly, I lay down, ignoring
them. I had to make my
friends go. Harry could literally
have shredded them. Footsteps:
the door closed; relief and loneliness
joined me, but only for a
moment.</p>

<p>His voice sliced the darkness:
"I'm a man of honor, and must
warn you. If we fight, you'll
lose. I escaped with far more
pills than you; you're weaker."</p>

<p>I said sardonically, "With you
stealing parts of my supply,
that's probably the only truthful
thing you've said!"</p>

<p>"I've been in here three
nights, adjusting my metabolism ..."</p>

<p>He came at me then, not
breaking his flow of speech. At
home, I'd have been surprised at
the dishonor. Instead, I was expecting
it. He ran into my balled
fist.</p>

<p>If we'd been home ... if, if,
if, if, if. At full strength, I
could have broken his neck with
the blow. Now, he simply rolled
back and fell. Laughing, he attacked
again. We were weak as
babes, and fought like it. Clumsily,
slowly, we went through
the motions.</p>

<p>He'd been right&mdash;he was a
little stronger, and the relative
difference began to tell. Soon I
was falling from his blows.</p>

<p>Hands on my neck, he kneed
me hard in the stomach. Violently
ill, I felt the sulfur dioxide
rush from my lungs.</p>

<p>I remembered one trick they'd
taught at school, and I used it.
Unable to break his hold, I managed
to get my hands around
his throat. We locked, each
silent.</p>

<p>Silent until I felt my last reserves
going, until the crooning
of the Song of Eternity began.
This couldn't happen, not to this
planet. With all my strength, I
gave one last squeeze&mdash;but it
failed. From somewhere, light-years
of light-years away, I
heard Frank, realized I'd played
the fool: she'd been working for
the monster.</p>

<p>A blinding flash inside my
head&mdash;and the Last Darkness
descended.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The light hadn't been inside
my head: it flooded the room.
Dimly, I was aware of the injection,
and immediately felt better.
Harry was gone.</p>

<p>The GG, minus one, was gathered
around. Mel said, "It was a
dilute solution of cerium nitrate.
We figured the percentage on
the basis of the pill Frank
swiped. Hope you aren't poisoned."</p>

<p>"No." My voice was weak,
"Need it. Oxidizing agent for
the sulfur."</p>

<p>"Harry's dead," Hazel frowned.
"When we came in, you'd
broken his neck, were crooning
to yourself."</p>

<p>So <i>I</i> had been crooning the
Song of Eternity? "I'm a"&mdash;I
felt silly&mdash;"a cop on a mission.
I waited until whichever of you
it was settled down here. That
one had to be the criminal, to be
done away with."</p>

<p>"Dex and I got rid of the
body," Mel said. "No need to
worry unless ... unless you've
read my stories. Perhaps <i>you</i>
are the criminal. I'll be watching."</p>

<p>"No proof, of course ... Do
<i>you</i> believe I'm the criminal?"</p>

<p>Mel smiled. "No, but I'll
watch anyway."</p>

<p>"More closely than tonight, I
hope," Hazel said acidly. "If it
hadn't been for her...."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I saw Frank, and was
ashamed of my suspicions. She
was silent, looking concerned.
They all did, and I was warmed.
Because, despite discomfort,
they worried about me, an alien,
a stranger. "Better leave. Heat's
getting you."</p>

<p>Dex asked, "When are you
going back?"</p>

<p>I shrugged. "Never. The ship
is in the Gulf of California ...
Harry did that."</p>

<p>"What about our company?
We can research anti-gravity.
You might reach home yet."</p>

<p>I shook my head. "Said I was
a policeman. I don't know very
much&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perfectly normal!" Mel said
before Hazel shooshed him.</p>

<p>Dex was insistent: "Any cop
knows at least something about
his motorcycle. Was I right
about the superconductor?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Now, get out of here,
idiots, before there's no one left
to form the company!"</p>

<p>Hazel, perspiring freely, red
hair shimmering, kissed me.
"We figured you out real, real
early. We aren't ever wrong,
and I'm glad we stayed with
you, Mr. Venus." She laughed
joyously, "First time I've ever
kissed a Venusian!"</p>

<p>Frank, head close to mine,
said softly, "I'm terribly sorry
I said those things, but you had
to believe I was angry, so I
could call the others&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I did everything possible
to get you out...."</p>

<p>We were silent; then I said
what I'd been fighting not to,
for so long. "Frank ... Francis?"</p>

<p>She understood, and stared
horrified at me. I'd lost. Bowed
my head, feeling like the damned
fool I was.</p>

<p>She looked around the room.
"It's so strange!"</p>

<p>"And with ingrained racial
conditioning, you couldn't respond
to a thin, sallow alien."</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said
hesitantly.</p>

<p>"I do!" Mel said. "The oldest
story in science fiction; it's
true; I can't write it."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"No editor in right or wrong
mind would buy the beautiful
Earth damsel, after whom lusts
the Monster from Venus&mdash;"</p>

<p>Frank snapped: "He isn't a
monster! And his manners are
better than many writers' I
could name ..."</p>

<p>Her voice trailed off with
awareness of Mel's tiny smile&mdash;a
smile that widened. He pulled
her toward the door. "What a
story! We'll hold the wedding in
a Turkish Bath."</p>

<p>Alone, I sighed, comfortable
again after three years. I was
grateful to the GG, and would
do anything, within limits, for
them. Yet, my newly adopted
planet needed protection. Babes
in the woods, they'd be torn to
pieces outside.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the GG didn't
know my meaning of "policeman",
my home's highest order
of intellect. I'd assure the group
finally getting anti-gravity and
use of planetary lines of force.
But not the hyperspace drive,
not for a good long while.</p>

<p>I certainly couldn't destroy
the GG's confidence. I couldn't
hurt them. They were so sure
about me&mdash;so sure they were
never wrong. How could I explain
I'd been looking for a decent,
habitable planet like Venus
to discharge my captive, that I
was from another galaxy?</p>
